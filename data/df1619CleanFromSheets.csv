In nonprofit spots - the budgets were so tight everyone complained all the time and had it hard...not as hard as me with untreated ADHD, depression and anxiety...but hard. It should have come up in all previous workplaces but I never feel safe bringing it up. I freelance now so I can deal with structuring my own work hours etc...but, I am really really struggling both due to isolation and just...freelancing is a real grind. If I didn't have Obamacare I would be completely screwed. AS it is I am only semi screwed. ALSO  - what I wish you would ask in this survey is about caretaking. 
I am female in IT..and disabled. I take care of my elderly mother and my developmentally disabled brother. 
What NEVER gets discussed is who does the caretaking in families when someone breaks down or is unable to work...it's women, sisters, daughters, mothers... So PLEASE work caretaking survey questions into your surveys.

I can't just say it's about me...I'm under water because no one is helping with my brother or mother..least of all my father who died penniless after years on wall street making millions. He was ADHD too...and alcoholic and depressed...but, he was a ""master of the universe"" type doing IPOs for tech companies...and a ""liberatarian""... 

So yeah - please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape. I'm screwed NOT just because of my disabilities...but my gender as well.

Sooo - this survey should have a ""Did we miss anything"" open question at the end. Two things. One - My ADHD is an asset when treated and understood...Also - When I finally got coverage at work 20 years ago...I was put on a med which I had a very bad reaction to - at work. Getting treated (after decades) ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so. Wrong meds *really* messed me up - along with wrong DX. I couldn't be open about it. And then had a serious breakdown at work...and was fired immediately. No mercy. No understanding - I told them what was going on and I was gone. Because I wasn't well.. I couldn't defend myself. I became homeless for a while. I'm OK now...but it was a *mess* caused BY getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depression...I was in Silicon Valley at the time and over 30 and female. There was NO space for me to be anything less that 120% perfect as I was one of very few women working in SV at the time.","I don't want to poison the well... people are prejudiced and in denial about their own issues and vulnerabilities I find...I wish I felt differently...","Yes, I experienced",53,"F","United States of America","Oregon","United States of America","Oregon",2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yes",1,"Rarely","Maybe","No",NA,"Yes, it has",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Certain sounds like the humming sound in a server room or the high pitched sounds from some electronic devices aggravate the issue. I also like to wear headphones and listen to sounds that numb the condition. In my experience it's best to make people aware of the issue so that they don't think I'm not listening to them if the environment sounds are drowning out their voice or that I'm ignoring them and want to be left alone simply because I'm wearing headphones.","Personally I would like to think that I would be open to discussing a mental health issue with a future employer. It would all depend on the individual(s) I was facing and whether I thought they were comfortable with hearing about it. My wife has been dealing with a mental health issue since childhood and has hidden it from her own family. I have tried to talk to some of her siblings regarding the issue and they don't really want to know or aren't comfortable with the subject and shut down the conversation immediately. This experience has made me keenly aware that it isn't a subject matter that everyone is happy to hear about and I wouldn't expect an interviewer to be different.","Yes, I observed",45,"M","Ireland",NA,"Ireland",NA,2019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,TRUE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,0,"Not applicable to me","No","Maybe",FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
